I really love learning about science (especially biology) in my free time, and I started learning computer science about two years ago. I'm enjoying it so far and wanted to find some ways to combine these two interests, which led me to BWSI! I also like to play and listen to music, and I've played the violin for 10 years. My favorite ice cream flavor is coffee!")
